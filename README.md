# NPQUEST
The **Natural Products** **Qualitative Unification**, **Evaluation**, **Scoring**, and **Tracking** script can be used to quickly select and rank nodes from a molecular network produced via [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu) and refined on [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/). 
## Requirements
- [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/)
- [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/)
- .csv file for the node table from Cytoscape. Ensure media blanks and nodes connected to them are removed **before** inputting into NPQUEST
- .csv file for the edge table from Cytoscape
